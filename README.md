# Pinit README


A simple extension to allow you pin files or folders to a view within the explorer.

## Requirements

I recommend you have an icon lib to make it clearer what you have pinned, but its not required.

## Known Issues

- Issue with building with pnpm, use `vsce package --no-dependencies`

Non... yet ;)

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.

### 1.0.0

Initial release.
